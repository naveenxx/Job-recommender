MongoDB

To change password of any User:

db.updateUser('username',{pwd:'thisisthepass'})
this changes the password, i thought root is the admin username but, it seems myUserAdmin is the admin username

and i accessed the admin simply with use admin . 

show users list all users

first the security is disabled in mongodb,

first i changed the admin password to 'password123' using

db.updateUser('myUserAdmin',{pwd:'password123'})

then i configured /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf file
by adding,

security:
	authorization: "enabled"

now we can login to mongosh but cannot access anything , to access something , 
we have to authenticate ourselves using db.auth(username,password)

this command will only work on our database, ie admin

so first , -> use admin
then, 
db.auth('myUserAdmin','password123')
now we are logged in ,


now for my project "job recommender",
I am gonna need to create a database and i have create a user to be admin for that database.
to do so , i have added the link of all roles for an user to raindrop
check that out ,

use jb #create database jb

now to create user,

db.createUser(
	{
		user:"jbadmin",
		pwd: passwordPrompt(), #jbadminpass
		roles:[
			{role:"readWrite",db:"jb"}
		]
	}
)


it seems we can only authorize users while using admin database


FInd()

To only include name from a document where username = aravind
db.coll.find({'username':'aravind'},{'name':1,{_id:0}})

mongo cursor objects are indexable
